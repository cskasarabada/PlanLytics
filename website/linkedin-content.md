## About Section (2000 characters max)

```
MicroPlan AI is the intelligent platform for incentive compensation management.

We unify plan analytics, revenue operations, and enterprise AI security into one stack — built for teams that manage sales compensation at scale.

Our platform helps compensation analysts, RevOps leaders, and HR operations teams:

- Analyze compensation plans with AI extraction, risk radar, and ICM-ready outputs
- Build and simulate plans with agentic guidance via Plan Studio
- Execute with pipeline intelligence, forecast confidence, and coaching plays through Sales 360 AI
- Deploy with enterprise-grade security through MicroLLM — our on-premise AI engine with zero data leakage

The MicroPlan AI Product Family:

MicroPlan AI — Plan analytics and governance. Upload a plan document and get risk assessments, ICM object blueprints, and executive summaries in minutes.

RevOps Studio — Plan Studio for plan creation with scenario simulation, and Sales 360 AI for pipeline health, forecast confidence, and compensation exposure.

MicroLLM — Lightweight, purpose-built language models that run on-premise. Supports Ollama, OpenAI, and Anthropic backends with automatic PII scrubbing, content guardrails, and grounding verification.

ICM PlanLytics — The analytics engine that maps compensation plan language to Oracle ICM objects, flags compliance risks, and generates deployment-ready export packs.

We believe compensation planning should be intelligent, secure, and fast. MicroPlan AI makes it possible.

### Post 1: Launch Announcement

```
Introducing MicroPlan AI — the intelligent platform for compensation planning.

We built MicroPlan AI because compensation plans shouldn't take weeks to analyze. Upload a plan document, and in minutes get:

- AI-extracted plan mechanics and structure
- Risk and compliance flags with recommendations
- ICM object blueprints ready for Oracle deployment
- Executive summaries for finance and HR

Powered by MicroLLM — our on-premise AI engine with zero data leakage.

### Post 2: MicroLLM Security Focus

```
Enterprise AI shouldn't mean sending sensitive compensation data to the cloud.

That's why we built MicroLLM — lightweight, purpose-built language models that run entirely on-premise.

What makes MicroLLM different:
- On-premise inference via Ollama (Phi-3, Llama 3.2, Gemma)
- Automatic PII scrubbing before any LLM call
- Content guardrails that block unsafe outputs
- Grounding verification to prevent hallucinations
- Cloud fallback (GPT-4o Mini, Claude Haiku) with PII scrub-first

Your compensation data never leaves your network.
